# i-audit
  
#### About
  - The goal of the project is to build a web application for personal financial management. 
  - The I-Audit website is a personal project that I've been working on to learn and practice modern technologies used in the industry for the development of software applications.
  - Node.js was the tool I used to develop the backend part of the system. 
  - The data was stored on a MySQL database, and the frontend was implemented using HTML and CSS. 
  - I also worked with Docker containers to host the database and the backend application.
  
  #### Project structure
  
  This project contains two folders:
- [docker/mysql](https://github.com/crsalves/i-audit/tree/main/docker/mysql): contains a docker-compose file used to run a docker container with a MySQL database. 
- [node-app](https://github.com/crsalves/i-audit/tree/main/node-app): hosts the code of the main node.js backend application.
